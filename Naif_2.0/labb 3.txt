q1	We reset IFS(0) we use IFSCLR(0) = 0xffff dont know why i have to reset all bits?

q2	If it was not reset to 0 the code would just go instantly after first time out, we would have no timer or delay

q3	IFS(0) is used to detet timeout event flag. A bit will change to 1 when a timeout is happening 
PR to define period and T2CON to set prescale

q4	display uppdates onece evry second, the buttons are updated fast and doesnt depend on the delay
if button is pressed and then change value and pressed agin within one second it will change to the lates value
